# RISCV CPU Project
Welcome to my RISCV CPU project. 
This repository hosts all of the source code used to simulate a 32 bit RISCV based CPU architecture.

## Motivation
- Putting all of the concepts learned from Adanvced Comp. Arch. into practice.
- Getting hands-on experience with microarchitecture outside of coursework
- I want to deepen and solidify my understanding of general purpose computing before attempting Domain Specific computing

## End Goals
My end goal of this project is:
- Out-of-Order Pipelined Microarchitecture
- Multi-level Cache (L1 and L2)
- I/O Subsystem
- Synthesis on Xilinx Artix 7 Board
**Note**: This goals could change along the exploration of this project.

## Supported ISA:
It currently supports:
- RV32I ISA

## Current Progress:
RTL Modules:
- [x] General Purpose Register File
- [ ] ALU Unit
